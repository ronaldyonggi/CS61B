# CS61B Spring 2019 Progress Tracker

This repository contains the progress of UC Berkeley CS61B course materials that I have completed.

## Progress Table

All course materials are based on the [Spring 2019](https://sp19.datastructur.es/) course.

Lecture notes are written in .ipynb files, which can be opened via Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab. Since this class mainly uses Java, installation of a Java kernel (I used [IJava](https://github.com/SpencerPark/IJava)) is required to execute the cells within the notebooks.
